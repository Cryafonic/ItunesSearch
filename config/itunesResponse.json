We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder:&#xa0;<i>Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this?</i>&#xa0;We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent—even from ourselves. <br /><br /> For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind:&#xa0;<i>There She Is</i>. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice—the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world’s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living.<br /><br /> Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender,&#xa0;<i>Untamed</i>&#xa0;is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of&#xa0;navigating divorce, forming a&#xa0;new blended family,&#xa0;and discovering that&#xa0;the&#xa0;brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not&#xa0;on its&#xa0;structure but&#xa0;on&#xa0;each member’s ability to&#xa0;bring&#xa0;her&#xa0;full&#xa0;self to the table.&#xa0;And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say:<i> There She Is</i>.<br /><br /> <i>Untamed</i>&#xa0;shows us how to be brave.

So when her best friend signs her up for the hot new reality television show, Can You Beat a Billionaire, Bella accepts the challenge and hopes against hope she can win the ten million dollar prize. If she doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s bye-bye pet clinic and shelter, bye-bye Chance Creek, Montana, and hello to marriage to the billionaire for a year!<br/>\n<br/>\nEvan Mortimer, billionaire, can&#39;t believe he&#39;s reduced to competing in a television contest to win a wife. Unfortunately, it&#39;s the only foolproof way to secure his position as head of Mortimer Innovations. At least he&#39;ll be able to dump his &#34;spouse&#34; at the end of the year; he&#39;s much too busy to be tied down to a country bumpkin cowgirl.<br/>\n<br/>\nBella doesn&#39;t expect her adversary to be handsome—or funny, or compassionate—but Evan&#39;s all three, and he&#39;s proving a tough competitor, too. When they end up sharing a tent—and a sleeping-bag—her body betrays her with a longing so deep it cuts her to the core. Still, this cowgirl must stay strong. If Evan uncovers her secret fears, he&#39;ll use them to win the contest—and then he&#39;ll own her for a year. She&#39;ll be out of luck, out of cash, and stuck being Mrs. Mortimer until he kicks her to the curb. Too bad she can&#39;t decide which is worse—winning the show and losing Evan forever, or losing the show and only being his temporary wife.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvan can&#39;t believe he&#39;s falling for the one woman who doesn&#39;t want him. This cowgirl&#39;s not impressed by his money, his name, or his inability to sleep in a tent with her for an entire night, but every look and touch she gives him sends his desire through the roof. With a director determined to use his claustrophobia to make him look like a fool, and an adversary so sexy he can hardly see straight, he&#39;ll need all his savvy to come out on top. Too bad he&#39;s going to lose no matter how this show turns out. If he beats Bella, he&#39;ll destroy the first woman he&#39;s ever loved. If he doesn&#39;t beat her, it&#39;s bye-bye Mortimer Innovations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill either of them remember in time that it&#39;s not who wins or who loses—it&#39;s how they play the game that really counts?<br/>\n<br/>\nCowboys of Chance Creek:<br/>\nBOOK 0: The Cowboy Inherits a Bride<br/>\nBOOK 1: The Cowboy&#39;s E-Mail Order Bride<br/>\nBOOK 2: The Cowboy Wins a Bride<br/>\nBOOK 3: The Cowboy Imports a Bride<br/>\nBOOK 4: The Cowgirl Ropes a Billionaire<br/>\nBOOK 5: The Sheriff Catches a Bride<br/>\nBOOK 6: The Cowboy Lassos a Bride<br/>\nBOOK 7: The Cowboy Rescues a Bride<br/>\nBOOK 8: The Cowboy Earns a Bride<br/>\nBOOK 9: The Cowboy&#39;s Christmas Bride","artistId":649806358,"artistName":"Cora Seton","genres":["Western","Books","Romance","Contemporary"],"price":3.99,"kind":"ebook","averageUserRating":4.5,"userRatingCount":220},{"artworkUrl60":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication124/v4/cc/5a/c4/cc5ac42e-beef-8359-c788-b138a27a2851/9781501156229.jpg/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication124/v4/cc/5a/c4/cc5ac42e-beef-8359-c788-b138a27a2851/9781501156229.jpg/100x100bb.jpg","artistViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/artist/ruth-ware/944758742?uo=4","trackCensoredName":"The Death of Mrs. Westaway","fileSizeBytes":7768388,"formattedPrice":"$9.99","trackViewUrl":"https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-death-of-mrs-westaway/id1329474168?uo=4","artistIds":[944758742],"genreIds":["9032","38"],"releaseDate":"2018-05-29T07:00:00Z","trackId":1329474168,"trackName":"The Death of Mrs. Westaway","currency":"USD","description":"<b>A “perfectly executed suspense tale very much in the mode of</b> <b>Daphne du Maurier’s <i>Rebecca</i>” (</b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>) from the #1 </b><b><i>New</i></b><b><i> York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author of <i>In a Dark, Dark Wood</i>, <i>The Woman in Cabin 10</i>, <i>The Lying Game</i>, and <i>The Turn of the Key</i>. </b><br /><br />On a day that begins like any other, Hal receives a mysterious letter bequeathing her a substantial inheritance.
